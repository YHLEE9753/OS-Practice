#### 1. Doubly_LinkedList using C
It is very simple program using double_linkedList
You can see more detail process of program and code in docx file
Through this project. I can use pointer to double_linkedlist more easily
<br><br>

#### 2. Creating Shell using JAVA
Make Shell using JAVA
It is program to show LILUX shell by using JAVA
You can see more detail and how execute program in CreatingShellUsingjava.docx file
<br><br>

#### 3. PID Manager using JAVA
Manage PID ID. 
We set maximum number of PID and make solution when the 
number of threads exceed maximum number.
We use synchronized way to solve it
You can see more detail process of program and code in docx file
<br><br>

#### 4. Solution of Dining Philosopher's Problem using JAVA
Dining Philosopher's problem is famous deadlock problem.
we use synchronized way to solve it
You can see more detail process of program and code in docx file
<br><br>

#### 5. Designing Virtual Memory Manager using JAVA
I use FIFO algorithm and LRU algorithm to design Virtual Memory Manager
You can see more detail process of program and code in docx file
